# Exercise-3

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# mkdir

* `mkdir`, the "Make Directory" command, creates a directory if used like so: 

    `mkdir Example` creates a folder with name "Example" within your current directory.
    * Great for using if you want a subfolder
    * Great for organization of your files
